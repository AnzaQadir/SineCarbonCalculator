# Personality Calculation Logging System

This system automatically logs all personality calculation responses to the database with comprehensive metadata for analytics and debugging.

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. Automatic Logging
When you call `POST /api/personality/calculate`, the system automatically:
- Records calculation start time
- Executes the personality calculation
- Records calculation end time and duration
- Saves the complete response to the database
- Logs detailed information to console

### 2. What Gets Logged

#### Database Storage (`user_personalities` table):
- **User Information**: `userId`, `sessionId`
- **Personality Results**: `personalityType`, `newPersonality`, `catalogVersion`
- **Complete Response**: Full JSON response from personality calculation
- **Metadata**: Quiz responses, calculation time, user agent, IP address
- **Performance**: Calculation time in milliseconds
- **Status**: Success/failure with error messages

#### Console Logging:
- Request start/end with timestamps
- Calculation duration
- User identification
- Success/failure status
- Detailed metadata

## üìä Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_personalities (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  userId UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  sessionId STRING REFERENCES user_sessions(sessionId),
  catalogVersion STRING,
  personalityType STRING,
  newPersonality STRING,
  response JSON NOT NULL,
  metadata JSON,
  ipAddress STRING,
  userAgent TEXT,
  calculationTimeMs INTEGER,
  status ENUM('success', 'failed') DEFAULT 'success',
  errorMessage TEXT,
  createdAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updatedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## üîß Usage Examples

### Basic Personality Calculation (with logging)
```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/personality/calculate' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "userId": "user-123",
    "sessionId": "session-456",
    "question1": "How often do you use public transport?",
    "answer1": "Sometimes"
  }'
```

### Personality Calculation (without logging)
```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/personality/calculate' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "question1": "How often do you use public transport?",
    "answer1": "Sometimes"
  }'
```

## üìà Analytics & Monitoring

### Performance Metrics
- Average calculation time
- Min/max calculation times
- Standard deviation
- Slow calculation detection (>1 second)
- Success/failure rates

### User Analytics
- Personality type distribution
- New archetype distribution
- Catalog version usage
- Geographic distribution (IP-based)
- Device/browser analytics

### Data Retrieval
```bash
# Get all personalities for a user
GET /api/user-personality?userId=user-123

# Get latest personality for a user
GET /api/user-personality/latest/user-123

# Get personality by ID
GET /api/user-personality/personality-id-123

# Get analytics stats
GET /api/user-personality/stats/analytics

# Get performance metrics
GET /api/user-personality/performance
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the test script to verify the logging system:

```bash
node test-personality-logging.js
```

This will test:
1. Personality calculation WITH userId (should log)
2. Personality calculation WITHOUT userId (should not log)
3. Retrieving logged personalities

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### Console Logs
The system provides detailed console logging with request IDs:
```
[req_1234567890_abc123] POST /api/personality/calculate - Started
[Personality] Starting personality calculation for user: user-123
[Personality] Calculation completed in 245ms for user: user-123
[UserPersonality] Saved personality calculation for user user-123
[req_1234567890_abc123] POST /api/personality/calculate - Completed in 245ms
```

### Database Queries
```sql
-- View all logged personalities
SELECT * FROM user_personalities ORDER BY createdAt DESC;

-- View performance metrics
SELECT 
  AVG(calculationTimeMs) as avg_time,
  MIN(calculationTimeMs) as min_time,
  MAX(calculationTimeMs) as max_time,
  COUNT(*) as total_calculations
FROM user_personalities 
WHERE status = 'success';

-- View failed calculations
SELECT * FROM user_personalities 
WHERE status = 'failed' 
ORDER BY createdAt DESC;
```

## üö® Error Handling

### Failed Calculations
- All failed calculations are logged with error details
- Error messages are stored in the database
- Calculation time is recorded even for failures
- Original request data is preserved

### Logging Failures
- If database logging fails, the main request continues
- Logging errors are logged to console
- No impact on user experience

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to 'development' for detailed logging
- Database connection settings (from your existing config)

### Catalog Version
Currently hardcoded to 'v1' in the controller. You can make this dynamic based on your catalog system.

## üìã Response Format

### Successful Response
```json
{
  "personalityType": "Eco in Progress",
  "newPersonality": "Strategist",
  "comprehensivePowerMoves": { ... },
  "_metadata": {
    "calculationTimeMs": 245,
    "logged": true,
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Failed Response
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to calculate personality",
  "calculationTimeMs": 45,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```
